A schloss has the best baeckerei in Berlin.
The most wettbewerbs beer drinkers gather in the Biergarten.
Every Hund in Berlin loves the smell of Bratwurst coming from the Hauptstrasse.
I had to rush to the flughafen because I was going to miss my flight!
But this didn't work well with my lederhose, so I went to the store and got myself a Dirndel
Leaving the store my BMW broke down. Fortunately a nice lady gave me a ride back to the schloss in her Porsche.
Although she was nice, her breath smelled like brot.
Thankfully, we had apfelkuchen to cover the smell.
We fought over the last piece because we are so wettbewerbsfaehig.
I missed my flight at the Flughafen and spent the night with the brot woman
I went to the baeckerei to have my favorite pasteries this morning.
The king eats his apfelkuchen in his schloss while his hund sleeps.
