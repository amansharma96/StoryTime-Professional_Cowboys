A schloss has the best baeckerei in Berlin.
The most wettbewerbs beer drinkers gather in the Biergarten.
Every Hund in Berlin loves the smell of Bratwurst coming from the Hauptstrasse.
I had to rush to the flughafen because I was going to miss my flight!
But this didn't work well with my lederhose, so I went to the store and got myself a Dirndel
Leaving the store my BMW broke down. Fortunately a nice lady gave me a ride back to the schloss in her Porsche.
